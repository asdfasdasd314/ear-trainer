### Todo
- System for taking in audio as input
    - mp3 files
- Use librosa tools to extract the melody from the harmonic components
- Use the FFT to extract all of the frequencies in the harmonic components, and from there obtain chords and melodiy
- System for obtaining data
    - Manually label a couple hundred songs that are free to download as mp3 files
- Train a recurrent neural network to pick out the key using chords and melodic components we derived
- Plotting system for interesting visualization?
- Identification of chords using key and melody

- Use this for data: https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#musdb18-compressed-stems
